## CKB Developer Training Log

### 2025-06-30 â€” JavaScript Development Track

**General JavaScript and crypto-related coding concepts**
- Worked through foundational JavaScript exercises on Exercism.io, focusing on:
  - Data structures (e.g., objects, arrays, and custom types)
  - Functional programming techniques (e.g., higher-order functions, closures, and immutability)
  - Algorithmic thinking (e.g., sorting, filtering, and data transformations)
- Explored cryptographic concepts through JavaScript exercises:
  - Implemented basic hash functions (SHA-256) using JavaScript.
  - Practiced encoding and decoding data using Base64 and hexadecimal in JavaScript.

**Practical (Hands-on) CKB Training (light)**
- Set up and configured local CKB devnet (using `offckb` CLI) for future JavaScript-driven interactions.
- Practiced creating basic transaction structures by directly using JSON-RPC calls (no Lumos):
  - Experimented with manually building simple CKB transactions using raw JSON objects.
  - Verified cell structure understanding (capacity, lock script, and data) via Nervos Explorer.
- Used CKB CCC SDK to explore basic wallet generation and simple transaction signing.
  - Looked at how to issue a simple custom token (xUDT) using CCC tools.
  - Practiced reading on-chain cell data with CCC to reinforce how cells store information.

### Key Takeaways
- Built stronger JavaScript fundamentals essential for future scripting and DApp interactions.
- Gained familiarity with foundational crypto concepts applicable to blockchain development.
- Improved practical understanding of basic Nervos transaction structures (excl. Lumos - deprecated).
